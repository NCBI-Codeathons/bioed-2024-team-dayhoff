# Project Summary
Briefly describe the developed curriculum package. Include the target audience (e.g., high school biology students) and highlight the NCBI resources used.

Students will explore the structure & evolutionary relatoinships in the Insulin Receptor gene. The premise is based on the question of why can diabetic cats use the same insulin as humans.

# Curricular Package Details
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.
  1. Use NCBI Structure database to find protein structures.
  2. Use ICN3D to visualize key mutations.
  3. Use ClinVar to identify clinically-relevant gene variants, and display them in ICN3D.
  4. Use protein homology resources to generate multiple sequence alignments from a species collection.

## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).

  1. Human insulin receptor NCBI Gene page: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3643
  2. Human insulin receptor structure bound to 4 insulin molecules: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/pdb/6SOF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/mmdb/mmdbsrv.cgi?Dopt=s&uid=181343)
  3. 
(working Google doc to be used during development) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JpeNqyG5Vt6PPsPShBwHitOZUnhFL4RzY-PW6xXj43E/edit


## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).
Question 1. "How many insulin receptor structures are there?"

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.

# NCBI Codeathon Disclaimer
This poject was created as part of the BioEd Summit Curricula-thon, a week-long event focused on collaborative development of data-driven learning experiences. While we encourage you to explore and adapt this project, please be aware that NCBI does not provide ongoing support for it.
