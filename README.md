# Project Summary
Briefly describe the developed curriculum package. Include the target audience (e.g., high school biology students) and highlight the NCBI resources used.

Students will explore the structure and evolutionary relationships in the insulin receptor.

Target Audience: Students that have successfully completed a majors level introductory biology course or equivalent. This exercise is intended to be completed as a guided case study completed in a 3 hour lab, distributed across lectures or hybrid between in person and self-directed work. 

Prerequisite Knowledge: Understanding of the Central Dogma, familiarity with protein structure and signaling cascades

# Curricular Package Details
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
- (Introduction) Learn about the role of the insulin receptor protein and insulin binding
    - Review the Central Dogma in the context of protein structure/function and gene sequence variation
- Successfully utilize a variety of NCBI databases and software to deepen understanding of ???
    - (Module 1) Use computational tools to model the protein structure
        - Explore the relationship between protein structure and function
        - Visualize and predict what effect a mutation will have on protein activity
    - (Module 2 and 3) Use computational tools to find and compare DNA sequences
    - (Module 4) Discuss implications of genetics on multifactorial disease
