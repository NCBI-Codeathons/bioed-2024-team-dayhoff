# Project Summary

Students will explore the structure and evolutionary relationships in the insulin receptor while being introduced to the genetic basis of disease.

Target Audience: Students that have successfully completed a majors level introductory biology course or equivalent. This exercise is intended to be completed as a guided case study completed in a 3 hour lab, distributed across lectures or hybrid between in person and self-directed work. 

Prerequisite Knowledge: Understanding of the Central Dogma, familiarity with protein structure and signaling cascades

NCBI Resources Utilized: iCn3D, ClinVar, SNPdb, BLAST, COBALT, Comparitive Genome Viewer, NCBI Gene, Structure, NLM Bookshelf, OMIM
Other Resources: PDB, GeneCards, Reactome
