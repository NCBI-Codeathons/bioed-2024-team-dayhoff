# Project Summary
Briefly describe the developed curriculum package. Include the target audience (e.g., high school biology students) and highlight the NCBI resources used.

Students will explore the structure & evolutionary relatoinships in the Insulin Receptor gene. The premise is based on the question of why can diabetic cats use the same insulin as humans.

# Curricular Package Details
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
- (Introduction) Learn about the role of the insulin receptor protein and insulin binding
    - Review the Central Dogma in the context of Protein Structure/Function and Gene Sequence Variation
- Successfully utilize a variety of NCBI databases and software to deepen understanding of ???
    - (Module 1) Use computational tools to model the protein structure
        - Explore the relationship between protein structure & function
        - Visualize & predict what effect a mutation will have on protein activity
    - (Module 2 & 3) Use computational tools to find and compare DNA sequences
    - (Module 4) Discuss implications of genetics on multifactorial disease 

Target Audience: Students that have successfully completed a majors level introductory biology course or equivalent. This exercise is intended to be completed as a guided case study completed in a 3 hour lab, distributed across lectures or hybrid between in person and self-directed work. 

Prerequisite Knowledge: Understanding of the Central Dogma, familiarity with protein structure and signaling cascades
